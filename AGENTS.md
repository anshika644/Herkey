## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository ("Herkey Lead magnets") is currently a bare/empty project with only a `README.md`. There is no application code, no package manager, no build system, and no services to run.

- **No dependencies to install** — no `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent exists.
- **No services to start** — no backend, frontend, or database configuration is present.
- **No lint, test, or build commands** — none are configured.

When application code is added in the future, this section should be updated with:
- The package manager and install command
- How to run lint, tests, and the dev server
- Any non-obvious setup caveats
